# Digital-image-processing
image processing course track 


This repository contains all the information about digital image processing discussed in the course era course provided by northwestern
university 
this repository does not contain the answers of the quiz rather contains the explanantion of the topics discussed which have been compiled from various sources under a single banner
this can serve as a track for both learners and me to get knowledge from this 

# install Python/MATLAB whichever is preferable if python then install matplotlib,numpy,scipy,cv2 and other libraries
